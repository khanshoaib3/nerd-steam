NerdSteam is a hobby project of mine where users can view trending and top games of Steam,
compare prices across platforms, view historical pricing, track player statistics, and more.
The app is built using Kotlin + Jetpack Compose following MVVM architecture with a clean and responsive UI.

Features:
- View currently trending games, top games (based on the player count) and also top records (all time most played game by player count).
- View the game details in a structured and responsive UI.
- See player statistics i.e., how many players on average played the game at a specific month.
- Compare prices and deals for a game from other platforms (like GOG, Humble Store).
- Set price alerts and bookmark games for quick access.
- Data is sourced from multiple sources such as Steam, SteamCharts, and IsThereAnyDeal, while also caching data locally for performance.


Desclaimer:
The project is not affiliated to Steam, SteamCharts, IsThereAnyDeal, or any other services that are used.
It's merely a wrapper of all of the mentioned websites and is not meant to replace them.
